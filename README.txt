KanjiDrawingUtils
=================

Creating an Optical Character Recognition system for Japanese characters.

This project tackles two different problems:

1. How can we classify kanjis with an inaccurate number of strokes?

2. How can we improve classification algorithms with knowledge of neural networks?

#1 includes datasets from the Chinese Language Database and data collected using a basic android application
#2 only uses the android data

Papers for 1. and 2. are included in matrix directory

TO RUN:

Run the file controller.Java to run the algorithms for #2.
